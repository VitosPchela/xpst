WebxPST server component installation
=====================================

To install this release of the WebxPST server component:
- on some Java 6 servlet/JSP container, deploy WebxPST.war
  * this currently must be deployed to the top-level URL /WebxPST on the server.
    For example, http://its.clearsighted.org/WebxPST
    This restriction will be removed in the future.
- The Firefox plugin for the client side of the tutor is currently hosted at
  https://its.clearsighted.org/webxpst/WebxPST.xpi
  Provide a link to this .xpi for your users.
  This will be hosted somewhere else in the future, but the update process should make
  that transparent to users.
- The task list in the sidebar is populated by a web page. Provide a web page like
  demomenu.html
  included in the .war file to instruct the user on how to start the tutor.
  In the future, the user will not need to click a 'Choose' button on the page, they'll just need
  to browse to the page with the sidebar open.

- Once installed, test by browsing to
  http://server/WebxPST/demomenu.html
  and following the instructions there.
- As a sanity check, you can also test the installation by browsing to
  http://server/WebxPST/WebxPST
  which should present an ugly menu of debugging options that starts like:
	Start test session:
	ct: Goalnode test Appnode test
	as: Goalnode test Appnode test
	...
