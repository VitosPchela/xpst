<div id="include">
<h3>include</h3>
Include the contents of another .xpst file. This is not a straight textual substitution (like C); in particular,
the included file must be fully parseable as an .xpst file on its own.

Includes are most useful for mappings that are reused, like <a href="#offpath">off-path</a> mappings.
</div>

<div id="options">
<h3>options</h3>
Options that apply globally to the file. There is only one option defined, and it is obsolete, so you can skip this section.
</div>

<div id="tutorname">
<h3>tutorname</h3>
Obsolete.
</div>

<div id="mappings">
<h3>mappings</h3>
Defines mappings between <a href="#appnode">appnode</a> names and goalnode names. There are several types of mappings:
<a href="#rename">rename</a>, <a href="#switch">switch</a>, and <a href="#concat">concat</a>. 
</div>

<div id="sequence">
<h3>sequence</h3>
Defines the acceptable sequences in which goalnodes can be completed. Overall, the sequence is a single expression with a semicolon
at the end. Parentheses group subexpression and operators combine subexpressions. Goalnode names are the atomic subexpressions.
<br/>
The operators are defined below.
</div>

<div id="feedback">
<h3>feedback</h3>
Defines answers, hints, JITs and variables for goalnodes.
</div>

<div id="comment">
<h3>Comments</h3>
Explain parts of the file to humans. These are simply discarded when the file is interpreted. Both single-line '#-style' and multi-line
'C-style' (/* ... */) comments can be used.
</div>

<div id="paren">
<h3>Parentheses</h3>
Group parts of a sequence expression.
</div>

<div id="brace">
<h3>Braces</h3>
Delimit file sections, enclose feedback attributes, and enclose JIT condition expressions.
</div>

<div id="gnname">
<h3>Goalnode name</h3>
Refers to a goalnode. The goalnodes in the sequence must refer to goalnodes defined in the 'feedback' section.
</div>

<div id="or">
<h3>or</h3>
Sequence operator that means either the left or right subexpression must be completed.
</div>

<div id="and">
<h3>and</h3>
Sequence operator that means both the left and right subexpressions must be completed, in either order.
</div>

<div id="then">
<h3>then</h3>
Sequence operator that means first the left subexpression, then the right subexpression must be completed.
</div>

<div id="until">
<h3>until</h3>
Sequence operator that means first the left subexpression, then the right subexpression must be completed. It differs from the
'then' operator in that the left subexpression stays mapped until the right subexpression is completed. (See the discussion of
mapping below.)
</div>

<div id="offpath">
<h3>Off-path</h3>
Error-Off-Path is just another goalnode name, but it represents a useful concept. In any task, there are often a lot of things that can be
done in the interface that are not relevant to the task, and may be harmful. The idea of an off-path goalnode is to have a place to catch all
these problems and give appropriate feedback. Appnodes can be mapped to such a goalnode through a <a href="#switch">switch</a> mapping, giving
a short textual description of each action that can be <a href="#substitution">substituted</a> in a JIT message.<br/>
<br/>
There are also usually appnodes that are useful some times, but not other times, in which case they can be mapped in the off-path mapping with
a lower <a href="#priority">priority</a> than the main mapping, so that they'll be mapped as off-path whenever they aren't mapped as part of the main
sequence.
</div>

<div id="rename">
<h3>Rename mapping</h3>
Mapping type that simply renames the node. For example, with the mapping
<div class="code">
ProblemNew:click =&gt; Click-New;
</div>
if the value '1' is sent from the ProblemNew:click appnode, the value '1' will be sent to the Click-New goalnode.
</div>

<div id="switch">
<h3>switch</h3>
Mapping type that maps a number of appnodes to one goalnode, with a different string value for each. These can be useful, for example, in
<a href="#offpath">off-path</a> mappings.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever a value is sent from an appnode in a switch, the appnode is matched to the string it's paired with, and that string is sent as
the value to the goalnode. In the <a target="example" href="example.html#offpath">Off-path example</a>, if someone clicked the AssessmentButton.childNodes-0 node,
the value "clicked on the Assessment view link" would be sent to the Error-Offpath node. This will trigger the JIT, and by <a href="#substitution">substitution</a>, the JIT message will be
"You clicked on the Assessment view link. That's not something you need to do right now.  Request a hint if you'd like to know what to do next."
</div>

<div id="substitution">
<h3>Substitution</h3>
Values can be substituted into the message strings in hints and JITs. Braces ('{' and '}') surround a variable name, and the value of that variable
at the time of the hint or JIT will be substituted there. There is a special variable 'v' that represents the value that the user input to the goalnode.
In the example above...
</div>

<div id="priority">
<h3>priority</h3>
Value that orders the priority of mappings when more than one are active for an appnode at the same time. These are useful, for example, in
<a href="#offpath">off-path</a> mappings.<br/>
If more than one mapping match an appnode at a time, the one with the highest priority is the one that is used.
</div>

<div id="answer">
<h3>answer</h3>
The correct answer for the goalnode. This can be a string, a number, or a <a href="#type">type</a>.
</div>

<div id="type">
<h3>Types</h3>

</div>

<div id="jit">
<h3>JIT</h3>
'Just In Time' message, that is delivered immediately to the user if the user inputs a wrong answer and the <a href="#jitcondition">JIT condition</a> is matched.
</div>

<div id="jitcondition">
<h3>JIT condition</h3>
Expression that specifies when this JIT will fire. The first JIT with a condition that matches will fire. A JIT with no condition will match unconditionally.<br/>
<br/>
JIT conditions can compare 'v', the input value, to a literal value or variable, with the operators '&lt;', '&gt;', '==', '!=', '&gt;=', '&lt;=', as appropriate for
the types being compared. Some examples:<br/>
<div class="code">
answer: 3;<br/>
# simple comparisons<br/>
JIT {v &gt; 3}: "too big";<br/>
JIT {v &lt; 3}: "too small";<br/>
...<br/>
answer: "hi";<br/>
JIT {v == "bye"}: "bye to you";<br/>
# this JIT would fire whenever the input was not 'hi' or 'bye'<br/>
JIT: "hi, not {v}";<br/>
...<br/>
answer: 5.5;<br/>
# simple comparison like above, but using 'answer' variable for comparison<br/>
JIT {v &gt; answer}: "too big";<br/>
JIT {v &lt; answer}: "too small";<br/>
...<br/>
answer: 5;<br/>
# JITs can check against strings, even if the answer is supposed to be a number.<br/>
# This might be useful in a text box where the user is allowed to type arbitrary strings.<br/>
JIT {v == RegEx("xy+z")}: "strange answer";<br/>
<!-- some empty space so that anchors will work at the end of the file -->
