#Description of the use of variables in an xPST file

*{answer}* - Refers to the correct answer of the current goal node.

Hint: "Answer is {answer}";

JIT : "Answer is {answer}";

*{v}* - Refers to answer entered by the student for the current goal node 

This variable can only be used in JITs and not in Hints.

It can be used both inside the JIT message as well as the condition.

JIT : "{v} is not the answer.";                            #default JIT
JIT {v < "-2"}: "Too small";
JIT {v < Subtract("a","b") }: "Too small";
JIT {v == Sum("a","b")}: “Answer is not the sum”;
JIT {v == Ans("a")}: "Cannot be the same.";
