This open source intelligent tutoring system has been developed with NSF SBIR funding that is intended to enable teachers and faculty (or anyone) to create intelligent tutors on existing software websites or for software for which you have the source code.

A key feature of xPST software is eavesdropping on user behavior so that feedback can be given appropriately. This API includes a Firefox plugin which logs user behavior within Firefox.

Recent work on xPST includes extending it to work with multiplayer game engines, with physiological data during learning, and with natural language processing (NLP).
