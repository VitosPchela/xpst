Release contents:
- updates.rdf - update file for WebxPSTExtension.
  - Note: this should only be deployed to the 'official' URL, which is currently
    https://its.clearsighted.org/webxpst/updates.rdf
- WebxPST.war - WAR archive for deployment to Java servlet/JSP container
- WebxPST.xpi - Firefox extension archive
- src - source for all of the above, as well as documentation, license, build files, etc.

Building:
- src/getandbuild.sh and src/release.sh are scripts to help with automating the release
  process. They may not be very useful for day-to-day development.
- xPSTLib, WebxPSTServer, and WebxPSTExtension/extensions each contain an Ant
  build.xml file. Each component can be built using Ant in the particular directory.
  Look through the targets in the build.xml files to familiarize yourself with what's
  available. The default target in each is useful for local development.
- Ant and its documentation are available at http://ant.apache.org/
- When developing the extension, rather than building and installing the .xpi into Firefox
  each time, it's best to skip building the XPI and just have Firefox point directly to
  the extension directory from which you are developing.
  To do this:
  - Install the XPI once to get Firefox acquainted with it.
  - Close Firefox
  - Find your Firefox extensions directory. For example, /home/me/.mozilla/firefox/default.uwi/extensions.
  - There should be a directory {7d8fe5ef-4859-42e7-abfd-3f2c5a30e46d} here. This is where the installed
    extension lives.
  - Remove the extension directory.
  - Point Firefox at your development directory:
    - On Unix-type platforms, you can softlink, like
      ln -s /home/me/projects/WebxPST/WebxPSTExtension/extensions/tutor/ {7d8fe5ef-4859-42e7-abfd-3f2c5a30e46d}
    - On Windows-type platforms, you can make a file named '{7d8fe5ef-4859-42e7-abfd-3f2c5a30e46d}'
      containing the path to the extensions/tutor/ directory, as text.
  - Start Firefox. You should see that the extension is still available, but the version number in
    the Add-Ons panel will be 'svn'.
